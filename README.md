ColorTones is a simple, colorful and customizable music player for your local music files. The project is running on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and
[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) for a (hopefully) cross-platform experience at some point, with lots of features planned.

## Work in progress sneak-peek

## Setting up a local test

Download the project source and simply run:
```sh
npm install
```
Followed by
```sh
npm start
```

## Supported platforms

In theory every platform supported by Electron should also extend to ColorTones, however testing has only been done on Windows 11 as of now.
The following build configs are available:
```sh
npm run build-win
npm run build-linux
npm run build-mac
```

## License

For now the project uses the standard MIT-license, but that may be subject to change depending on future dependencies used in the project.
